## 🚨 The Problem
Every day, millions of elderly and non-tech-savvy users are targeted by:
- **Fake Payment Receipts:** Photoshopped screenshots used to steal goods.
- **Phishing Messages:** "You won a car" scams in local languages (Roman Urdu/Hindi).
- **Social Engineering:** Emotional manipulation to trigger bank transfers.

## 💡 The Solution: VerifAI
VerifAI is a browser-based defense layer powered by **Gemini 3 Pro**. It does not just "read" text; it performs forensic analysis on images and understands cultural context.

### Key Features
- **🕵️ Forensic Vision:** Scans uploaded receipts for mismatched fonts, pixel artifacts, and editing traces.
- **🧠 Context Engine:** Understands slang and Roman Urdu (e.g., *"Easypaisa krdo"*).
- **⚡ Real-Time Verdict:** Instantly flags content as **SAFE (Green)** or **SCAM (Red)** with a generated explanation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Core Intelligence:** Google Gemini 3 Pro (Vision & Reasoning capabilities).
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (Vibe Code).
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages / Localhost.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Add your API Key in `script.js` (or `.env` if running locally).
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.
4. Drag and drop a suspicious screenshot to test the defense grid.
